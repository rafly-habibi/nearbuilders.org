Runtime apps that compose, verify, and evolve without rebuilding — built on [Module Federation](https://module-federation.io/), [every-plugin](https://plugin.everything.dev/), and [NEAR Protocol](https://near.dev/).

A published `bos.config.json` defines how host, UI, and API load together. Changing the config changes the composition. UI and API remotes do not need to be rebuilt for URL changes, though the host still needs a restart to pick up a new runtime config snapshot today. The configuration lives on-chain — inspectable, verifiable, and extendable by anyone.

This repository is the parent runtime platform: it contains the host, the reference UI, the reference API, and the CLI/tooling used to create and run child project remotes.

Built with [Tanstack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start), [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/), [oRPC](https://orpc.dev/), [better-auth](https://better-auth.com/), and [rsbuild](https://rsbuild.rs/).

## Quick Start

```bash
bunx everything-dev@latest init
```

## Repo Identity

Use this repo in two modes:

1. As the parent runtime platform that defines the host/runtime gateway in `host/` and the CLI in `packages/everything-dev/`.
2. As the reference app that demonstrates a runtime-composed UI/API/plugin stack driven by `bos.config.json`.

Child projects created from this platform should stay config-driven and treat this repository as the upstream host/runtime implementation.

## Why

Two main reasons:

1. I'm tired of constantly maintaining similiar logic and infrasturcture across multiple projects
2. While agents are good at creating prototypes, vibe coding typically comes with security flaws. This framework provides a type-safe starting point, extended from production ready code, on an upgradable runtime, with an incredibly simple deployment flow (publish a JSON and restart a Docker image).

When solutions are optimized to solve these two problems, a byproduct is more creativity in safety and immense possibility, especially in the era of generative interfaces.

For the full argument, see [A New Renaissance: Why Software Must Compose or Collapse](./docs/article-new-renaissance.md).

## CLI Commands

`everything-dev` is the canonical runtime package and CLI. `bos` is a command alias for the same tool. See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the quick reference and [LLM.txt](./LLM.txt) for the full technical guide.

### Development

```bash
everything-dev dev --host remote   # Remote host, local UI + API (typical)
everything-dev dev --ui remote     # Isolate API work
everything-dev dev --api remote    # Isolate UI work
           |/ --proxy              # Use a proxy
everything-dev dev                 # Full local, client shell by default

# `bos` is an alias for the same commands
bos dev --ssr                      # Opt into local SSR
```

### Production

```bash
everything-dev start --no-interactive   # All remotes, production URLs
```

### Build & Publish

```bash
bos build               # Build all packages (updates bos.config.json)
bos publish             # Publish config to the temporary dev.everything.near registry
bos publish --deploy    # Build/deploy all workspaces, then publish
bun run publish         # Same publish command via root script
bos sync                # Sync from production (every.near/everything.dev)
```

### Project Management

```bash
bos create project <name>   # Scaffold new project
bos info                    # Show configuration
bos status                  # Check remote health
bos clean                   # Clean build artifacts
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

- **UI Changes**: Edit `ui/src/` → hot reload automatically → publish with `bos publish --deploy`
- **API Changes**: Edit `api/src/` → hot reload automatically → publish with `bos publish --deploy`
- **Host Changes**: Edit `host/src/` or `bos.config.json` → publish with `bos publish --deploy`

### Before Committing

Always run these commands before committing:

```bash
bun test        # Run all tests
bun typecheck   # Type check all packages
bun lint        # Run linting (see lint setup below)
```

### Changesets

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning:

**When to add a changeset:**
- Any user-facing change (features, fixes, deprecations)
- Breaking changes
- Skip for: docs-only changes, internal refactors, test-only changes

**Create a changeset:**
```bash
bun run changeset
# Follow prompts to select packages and describe changes
```

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) handles versioning and GitHub releases automatically on merge to main.

Production releases actually flow through `.github/workflows/packages-release.yml` first:

1. Push changesets to `main`
2. `Packages Release` creates or updates the `chore: version packages` PR
3. Merge that version PR
4. `Packages Release` runs again with no pending changesets and calls `.github/workflows/release.yml`
5. `release.yml` runs `bun run deploy`, updates `bos.config.json`, and publishes the config to FastKV

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Runtime Configuration** - All URLs from `bos.config.json` (no rebuild needed)
- ✅ **Independent Deployment** - UI, API, and Host deploy separately
- ✅ **Type Safety** - End-to-end with oRPC contracts
- ✅ **UI Runtime Boundary** - `everything-dev/ui/client` and `/server` own router/runtime glue
- ✅ **CDN-Ready** - Module Federation with [Zephyr Cloud](https://zephyr-cloud.io/)

## Multi-Tenant Status

The host now supports a fixed-core tenant mode for domain-based UI composition.

What works today:
- The host still boots once from one base `RuntimeConfig`.
- Auth, API, and server-side plugin routers stay fixed from that base config.
- `extends` is the lineage edge between runtimes.
- `account` is the tenant namespace root for the active runtime.
- `domain` is the public ingress for that runtime.
- Requests can resolve account-relative tenant runtimes from subdomains, such as `alice.linktree.com -> bos://alice.linktree.near/linktree.com`.
- Tenant configs must extend the base BOS runtime.
- Per-request tenant overrides can currently change:
  - `app.ui`
  - existing `plugins.<pluginId>.ui`
  - existing `plugins.<pluginId>.sidebar`
- Tenant SSR is gated by `TENANT_WHITELIST` and `ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_SSR`.

Design direction:
- nested labels compose onto the active runtime account, such as `chicago.pizza.com -> bos://chicago.pizza.pingpayio.near/pizza.com`
- a runtime can extend another runtime and still become a new tenant root on its own domain

What does not work yet:
- tenant-specific API overrides in fixed-core mode
- tenant-specific auth overrides
- loading new plugin IDs dynamically per tenant
- full per-request host/plugin/auth/api swapping

That fuller hot-swap path is still documented in [`plans/runtime-config-hot-swap.md`](./plans/runtime-config-hot-swap.md), but the current production-ready path is shared host + request-scoped tenant UI.

## Configuration

All runtime configuration lives in `bos.config.json`:

```json
{
  "account": "dev.everything.near",
  "domain": "everything.dev",
  "staging": { "domain": "staging.dev.yourapp.dev" },
  "repository": "https://github.com/nearbuilders/everything-dev",
  "testnet": "dev.allthethings.testnet",
  "plugins": {
    "template": {
      "development": "local:plugins/_template"
    }
  },
  "app": {
    "host": {
      "name": "host",
      "development": "local:host",
      "production": "https://..."
    },
    "ui": {
      "name": "ui",
      "development": "local:ui",
      "production": "https://...",
      "ssr": "https://..."
    },
    "api": {
      "name": "api",
      "development": "local:api",
      "production": "https://...",
      "variables": {},
      "secrets": []
    },
    "auth": {
      "name": "everything-dev_auth-plugin",
      "development": "local:plugins/auth",
      "production": "https://...",
      "variables": {
        "account": "dev.everything.near",
        "hostUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
        "uiUrl": "http://localhost:3003"
      },
      "secrets": ["AUTH_DATABASE_URL", "BETTER_AUTH_SECRET"]
    }
  }
}
```

The temporary publish registry currently points at `dev.everything.near`, and `bos publish --deploy` is the release path when you want Zephyr URLs refreshed first.

### Railway

Use the repo `Dockerfile` for the service, and treat the GHCR image as the deployable artifact.

- Image source: `ghcr.io/nearbuilders/everything-dev:latest`
- Staging: `ghcr.io/nearbuilders/everything-dev:staging`
- Preview: Railway PR Environment URL for the host service, sourced from the same image-backed service configuration as the base environment

All configuration derives from `bos.config.json` (baked into the image). Only secrets need to be set as environment variables.

Required runtime vars:
- `APP_ENV` - `production` or `staging` (derives domain from `bos.config.json`)
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Session encryption key
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` - Auth callback URL (defaults to host URL from config)
- `HOST_DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
- `HOST_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` - Database auth token
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - Comma-separated allowed origins (defaults to host + UI URLs from config)

See [LLM.txt](./LLM.txt) for the complete schema and configuration reference.

## Lint Setup

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
bun lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
bun lint:fix

# Format code
bun format
```

Biome is configured in `biome.json` at the project root. Generated files (like `routeTree.gen.ts`) are automatically excluded.
