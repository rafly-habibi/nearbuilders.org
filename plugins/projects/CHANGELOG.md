# @everything-dev/projects-plugin

## 1.3.3

### Patch Changes

- b662086: Fix sidebar navigation to derive from plugin sidebar items and include projects

  - Updated `ui/src/routes/_layout.tsx` to properly consume generated `pluginSidebarItems` instead of using hardcoded navigation.
  - Fixed `packages/everything-dev/src/sidebar.ts` so the core `home` item points to `/home` (logo/dot still links to `/` for repository markdown render).
  - Added `plugins.projects.sidebar` to `bos.config.json` so the projects plugin appears in generated navigation.
  - Regenerated `ui/src/lib/plugin-sidebar.gen.ts` via `bos types gen` to include the `projects` sidebar item.
  - Fixed unbalanced JSX structure in `_layout.tsx` and removed stale/unused imports.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- b193ad6: Fix `reqHeaders` runtime type to be a real `Headers` instance instead of `Record<string, string>`, preventing `TypeError: undefined is not a function` when calling `.get()` in plugin handlers

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 13f68ff: Inject `getRawBody` and `reqHeaders` into oRPC handler context so plugins can verify webhook signatures

  - Host session middleware now clones the request body before oRPC consumes it, exposing `getRawBody()` in context for raw body access
  - Dev server middleware also injects `reqHeaders` and `getRawBody` (previously passed `context: {}`)
  - API, projects, registry, and template plugins declare `getRawBody` in their context schemas
  - API plugin `reqHeaders` type changed from `z.custom<Record<string, string>>()` to `z.record(z.string(), z.string())` for proper runtime validation

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c5fecc9: Switch from PGlite to Docker Postgres for development, fix multi-instance WASM crash, add auto-migration and infinite scroll for projects

  The host was crashing with `RuntimeError: Aborted()` because multiple PGlite WASM instances cannot coexist in a single Node.js process. This replaces in-process PGlite with Docker Postgres for development, and adds several related fixes:

  - Add `docker-compose.yml` with 3 postgres:17-alpine services (api:5432, auth:5433, projects:5434)
  - Add `dev:postgres`, `dev:postgres:down`, `dev:postgres:reset` convenience scripts
  - Declare `API_DATABASE_URL` and `PROJECTS_DATABASE_URL` secrets in `bos.config.json` so the host injects them into plugins
  - Conditionally disable SSL for localhost connections in `createDatabaseDriver` (3 files)
  - Add auto-migration to API and projects plugins on startup (matching auth plugin's existing pattern)
  - Fix projects `listProjects` pagination: move visibility filter from JS post-filter to SQL WHERE clause, add offset-based cursor pagination
  - Add infinite scroll with IntersectionObserver to projects list UI
  - Default project visibility to `public` instead of `private`
  - Show all visible projects (public/unlisted from everyone + own private) instead of filtering to current user only
  - Fix CI: replace broken `file:./api-test.db` with postgres service container

- f3f9e64: Migrate projects and API plugins to PostgreSQL with pglite fallback, add generic upvote system with SSE live ranking, and redesign projects page as a real-time ranked leaderboard.

  ### What Changed

  **API Plugin**

  - Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL (`pg` production, `pglite` local fallback)
  - Added `upvotes` table with unique constraint on `(thing_id, user_id)`
  - New upvote endpoints: `upvoteThing`, `downvoteThing`, `getUpvoteCount`, `getUpvoteFeed`
  - Real-time SSE stream at `/api/upvotes/stream` with in-memory pub/sub
  - Unified database defaults to `pglite:.bos/<plugin>/:memory:`

  **Projects Plugin**

  - Migrated from SQLite/libsql to PostgreSQL (same driver pattern as auth)
  - Dropped KV store (`kvStore` table, `KvService`, and all KV routes)
  - Regenerated Drizzle schema with `pgTable` and `timestamp with time zone`
  - Unified database defaults to `pglite:.bos/projects/:memory:`

  **Auth Plugin**

  - Updated default `AUTH_DATABASE_URL` to `pglite:.bos/auth/:memory:`
  - Driver now detects `:memory:` basename for true in-memory mode

  **UI**

  - Complete redesign of projects list page
  - Full-width horizontal cards with rank numbers (`#1`, `#2`, etc.)
  - Vote stack on right (↑ count ↓)
  - Projects sorted by upvote count descending
  - Framer Motion `Reorder.Group` for smooth rank transitions
  - SSE integration pushes live vote updates that trigger re-sorting
  - Removed legacy `keys/` KV test routes and UI

  **Config**

  - Updated `.env.example` with new PostgreSQL default comments
  - Removed `keys/**` from `bos.config.json` projects plugin routes

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- a0c5784: Upgrade `@hono/node-server` to `^2.0.1` across host and everything-dev packages.

  Bump dev dependencies group:

  - `@biomejs/biome` `2.4.10` → `2.4.14`
  - `@effect/language-service` `^0.84.3` → `^0.85.1`
  - `@electric-sql/pglite` `^0.2.0` → `^0.4.5`
  - `@vitest/ui` `4.1.2` → `4.1.5`

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 0a67206: Refactor dev orchestrator to service-descriptor architecture; add NEAR auth contract routes (nonce, verify, profile, relay, view); consolidate session queries in UI; add source-map devtool for plugin builds

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c0452e7: Renamed `productionIntegrity` to `integrity` across all schemas, build configs, and `bos.config.json`. Added `name` and `version` fields to `BosPluginRef`. Enhanced `bos plugin add` with `bos://account/plugins/name` registry resolution, manifest validation, and automatic integrity computation. Enhanced `bos plugin publish` with manifest validation, integrity computation, and FastKV plugin registry writes. Added generic KV routes (`kvGet`, `kvList`, `kvPrepareWrite`, `kvRelayWrite`) to the registry plugin.

### Patch Changes

- 368c872: Improve plugin lifecycle cleanup, add additionalExports, and share BosConfigInput

  Plugin shutdown now logs warnings instead of silently swallowing errors. DB layers use Effect acquireRelease for proper connection cleanup. Build system supports additionalExports for bundling extra type files. BosConfigInput is now exported from everything-dev/types for shared use. Registry plugin validates private key format before creating relay clients.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4efd2db: ## Extract business logic into plugins

  ### Breaking changes (api)

  All business routes have been removed from the `api` package. The API is now a thin structural shell with only health and error routes:

  - **Removed**: `listRegistryApps`, `getRegistryApp`, `getRegistryAppsByAccount`, `getRegistryAppByHost`, `getRegistryStatus`, `prepareRegistryMetadataWrite`, `relayRegistryMetadataWrite` (moved to `plugins/registry/`)
  - **Removed**: `listKeys`, `getValue`, `setValue`, `deleteKey` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Removed**: `listProjects`, `getProject`, `createProject`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject`, `listProjectApps`, `linkAppToProject`, `unlinkAppFromProject`, `listProjectsForApp` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Removed**: `listApiKeys`, `createApiKey`, `deleteApiKey` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Removed**: `listOrgMembers`, `listOrgInvitations`, `cancelInvitation`, `resendInvitation` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Kept**: `ping`, `authHealth`, `publicError`, `protectedError`
  - **Kept**: `requireAuth`, `requireNearAccount`, `requireOrgRole` middleware (duplicated in plugins)

  ### New: registry plugin (`@everything-dev/registry-plugin`)

  FastKV app discovery, metadata publish/relay. No database required.

  - All registry routes from the API are now under `apiClient.registry.*`
  - Configuration via `REGISTRY_RELAY_*` secrets and optional `registryNamespace` variable

  ### New: projects plugin (`@everything-dev/projects-plugin`)

  Projects CRUD, KV store, org management, API keys. SQLite via libsql.

  - All projects/KV/org/API key routes from the API are now under `apiClient.projects.*`
  - Configuration via `PROJECTS_DATABASE_URL` and `PROJECTS_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` secrets

  ### UI changes

  Stale route files for organizations, keys, apps, and settings pages were removed. Project pages (detail, list, new) were later restored to work with the namespaced projects plugin client.

  All `apiClient` calls to business routes must now use namespaced access:

  - `apiClient.listRegistryApps()` → `apiClient.registry.listRegistryApps()`
  - `apiClient.getProject()` → `apiClient.projects.getProject()`
  - `apiClient.listKeys()` → `apiClient.projects.listKeys()`
  - etc.

### Patch Changes

- 96a492e: Add SRI integrity hashes to plugin deployments

  Plugin rspack configs now compute SHA-384 integrity hashes on deploy and write `productionIntegrity` to `bos.config.json`, matching the existing behavior of `api`, `ui`, and `host` packages.
